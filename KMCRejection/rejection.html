    <h1>Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) Rejection Algorithm</h1>
    <h2>What is a KMC algorithm?</h2>
    <p>
        A <b>KMC</b> algorithm is a computer algorithm that intends to replicate
        the behavior of systems that are not necessarily in equilibrium.
        <b>KMC</b> simulations try to give insights on the behavior of systems 
        that interact through different processes that can occur within a well
        defined set of rules. What characterizes <b>KMC</b> simulations from
        other Monte Carlo methods, is that <b>KMC</b> algorithms try to make
        a more thorough exploration of the accessible states to a system, thus
        giving insight of the different pathways from a given state to a
        different state, without going through, potentially, unphysical states.
        This is useful to calculate non-equilibrium, and thermodynamic,
        properties of the systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are limitations, however, since <b>KMC</b> simulations requires
        the user to input the rates of each process of the system, i.e., the
        simulations itself cannot calculate the rates. Thus, the rates must be
        calculated through theory or experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to notice that <b>KMC</b> simulations assume that the
        processes are Poisson distributed, such that the time evolution is
        \[\Delta t = \ln(n)/R_{tot}\]
        where \(R_{tot}\) is total rate of the system and \(n\) is a random
        number in the range \((0,1)\); a proper demonstration can be found
